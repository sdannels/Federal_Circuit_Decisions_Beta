                analyze decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
                The Compendium includes all opinions, orders, and summary affirmances that were
                released on the Federal Circuit’s website—essentially all opinions since 2004 and 
                all summary affirmances since 2007, along with numerous orders and other documents. 
                Multiple fields are coded in a standardized format that will allow future 
                researchers to avoid recollecting fundamental fields such as case names or opinion dates. 
                The database also has the capacity for expansion, and new information about the decisions can 
                easily be added.  Public access to the database is provided in an easy-to-use web-based 
                interface that allows for immediate visualization of data.""")
